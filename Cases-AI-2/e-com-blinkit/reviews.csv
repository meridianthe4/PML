                recently I got a used item and when I talked to support team
                they keep asking me for clearer image of product although the
                image was perfectly fine. They is no further option for help. I
                can't tolerate this kind of cheating and also the prices are
                also on higher side, compare to others.",blinkit

                no other quick delivery agent in my area so I can't compare. I
                would have given 4 star but 1 star is because of the frustration
                for whenever there is an issue, you would end up getting
                frustrated with the customer care. Not really ""caring"" for their
                customers. But anyway, I'm stuck with them since I'm have no
                option to switch to someone else.",blinkit

                some electronic products that arrived faulty. I’ve been trying
                to reach customer support, but my chat sessions keep getting
                disconnected with the message, ""we are currently experiencing a
                high volume of queries."" Initially, I thought it was a one-time
                issue, but after 3-4 attempts, I received the same response. I
                then checked on my other, less expensive orders and found that
                customer care was readily available. BE CAREFUL WITH THIS AP",blinkit
5,29 August 2024,"I've been using Blinkit for a while now, and it has become my
                go-to app for grocery shopping. The app is well-designed, easy
                to navigate, and offers a wide range of products. The best part?
                Super quick delivery, often within minutes! However, one area
                where Blinkit could take a leaf out of Swiggy's book is the
                delivery charges. While I appreciate the speed, the added
                delivery fee cn sometimes make small purchase option or a
                membership model like instamart would definitely elevate the

                there’s been no resolution. To make matters worse, they closed
                the ticket without resolving the issue, and now I can’t raise

                out of stock and were not delivered. Upon receiving the order, I

                deliver. Then why advertise Grocery in 10 minutes ? If you are
                taking a surcharge, then deliver in 10 mins, else don't charge
                extra. I feel this App is useful only on those days when I am

1,29 November 2024,"Review: Excessive Delivery Charges on Blinkit I’ve been a
                frequent user of Blinkit, but lately, I’ve noticed the delivery
                charges are becoming excessive. While the app does communicate
                these charges upfront, the amount feels unreasonably high for
                short distances or small orders. It’s discouraging, especially
                for customers who rely on the service for convenience. Blinkit
                should consider revising their pricing model or offering more
                affordable delivery options. High charges can push loyal users",blinkit

                  suggested that in CoD orders unless he confirms that cash is

                  Without notifying they canceled my order three dqys after
                  placing my order. When I called customer care tgey said they

                  clear. After following up for the 3rd time, they say that the
                  product is not covered under returnable items. So, even if the

1,17 August 2021,"WORST SERVICE FROM JIOMART. I have been hearing this from many
                  persons that now Jiomart is not able to fulfill the order and
                  at the end they simply cancel the order taking side of some
                  technical error. The same thing happened with my order which
                  was placed 2 days back and cancelled. With this, I want to
                  tell you that this was my last order to Jiomart as we don't
                  have that much of time to waste while preparing shopping cart
                  with all needful items and then wait for 2-3days for those
                  & order cancel",jiomart

                  product and cheat customers. I have to call multiple times

                  Horrible experience. Please check your order once you receive
                  in front of people who deliver, there can be items missing.",jiomart
2,30 July 2020,"Happy to see the big discounts on Jiomart compare to your
                  other competitors. BUT: 1. The UI of app is very immature,
                  many options require multiple clicks to work. It's very slow
                  too. 2. It doesn't have that easy browsing as BB 3. In my
                  first ever order on Jiomart you have missed 5-6 items to scan
                  & send (this is negligence in service). I am using BB from
                  last 7 years if you want the long term Customers to move to ur
                  services you have to improve overall. Then I may change my 2

                  have to restart the viewing activity in the app to see those
                  grocery items again. 2. My first ordering experience via app
                  is extremely bad. They have cancelled my first order suddenly
                  on the next day without giving any reason. User experience of

                  checking something on the app and the order was placed without
                  even asking for confirmation. The customer service team is

                  up and no refund so far. Worst the customer support is an
                  automated voice guiding me back to the app. How many such

                  I went for Paytm, but then they show me that high traffic has
                  hindered process, so try again later. So the whole cart went
                  empty for some reason. So I ordered the same products again,
                  this time cash mode. Now I see two orders in my order list.
                  Also, as I said, the app is so slow, it took me 10 minutes to

                  but after 1 successful order they blocked my wallet and in

                  without any reason and don't talk them Straightly. I have 2

                  after that there is no coupon in my wallet and they charge

                  customer service. As a long-time customer, I've always been
                  impressed by their service. However, my recent experience has
                  been quite disappointing. I had to return a product for a
                  legitimate reason, but Zepto refused to address my issue. This
                  lack of respect for a loyal customer is unacceptable. As a
                  result, I and my family will no longer be using Zepto.",zepto

                  product of poor quality within just 1 hour of delivery. Such
                  practices reflect poor customer service and lack of
